# Flask Project

This is my first Flask project, and I intend to keep track of all the changes and challenges that I come across during the execution.

1. My first step, is to follow a [guide](https://tasnuva2606.medium.com/dockerize-flask-app-4998a378a6aa) to create a sumple docker image with flask.
1. After that, I followed the basic [tutorial](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/tutorial/index.html) from Flask to create a blog.
1. Additional [documentation](https://github.com/jazzdd86/alpine-flask) regarding the creation of a Flask image based on a Alpine docker image
